sdir is a utility to create a hash from a filesystem heirarchy. This hash is generated by creating a merkel tree that
directories are it's nodes and files (and other inode types) are it's leafs. You can select wich metadata to include in
generation of this tree; such as access time, permission or others.

By default, sdir just prints the hash of tree's root wich is sufficient to detect any change in this hierarchy, but if
you want to find the location of change precisselly, you can have a *complete* tree dump.
